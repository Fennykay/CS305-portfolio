    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial organization focused on storing and transferring sensitive documents. Their clientele are businesses and individuals from around the world, seeking to have a secure form of storage.
  
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Secure coding is vital to protect data and property on a global scale, everybody uses some form of financial storage for work/retirement accounts.Loss of information is something that would be beyond detrimental to the reputation and livelihoods of millions. Coding secure software helps to secure information and protects the company's best interests.

    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The dependency checks was vital to the efficiency of this project. The time save of having an automated tool to check dependencies vs checking each individually by hand is beyond valuable.

    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
This was done through evolutionary testing, this continuing throughout the entirety of development to ensure a useable product is always being produced. This ensuring no bugs are introduced througha  certain stage that will then make it's way to later iterations of the product.

    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
A rather increasing amount of documentations and stack overflow to continue to get outside perspectives on best strategy. Everything has been coded already, we just need to understand the best way to do things.

    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The use of hash functions, certificate creation, and ability to understand and update dependencies.
